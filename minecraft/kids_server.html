        <p>Hi folks! I'm thinking of running a local Minecraft Realms server for our son's friends, this website is for
            useful links and info.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What is Realms?">What is Realms?</h2>
        <p>Minecraft Realms is Microsoft's private Minecraft servers hosted in the cloud. It runs on their systems and
            they keep it up to date and secure; it is private, we control it and only people we invite can join.</p>
        <p>See <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/realms-tutorial"
                target="_blank">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/realms-tutorial</a> for some detailed
            information.</p>
        <p>There's also <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                aria-label="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/parents--guide-minecraft" rel="noopener"
                class="external-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/parents--guide-minecraft"
                target="_blank">the parent's guide to minecraft</a> which is a good basic guide to Minecraft, including
            a lot of links to settings.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What does it cost">What does it cost</h2>
        <p>The cost is about Â£7 a month - and that gives us up to 10 simultaneous players. You can have more people with
            accounts but 10 logged in at once.</p>
        <p>Note you <em>also</em> may have to pay extra for online access on some systems. Nintendo Switch users need
            Nintendo Switch Online, Playstation users need a Playstation Network account. Android users don't need any
            extra payment.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What do we need to play?">What do we need to play?</h2>
        <p>You need a system that can run the current version of Minecraft Bedrock. (There is also Minecraft Java which
            is very similar, but most kids have Bedrock) - this is probably one of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Android phone or tablet</li>
            <li>An iPhone or iPad</li>
            <li>A Nintendo Switch</li>
            <li>A Playstation or XBox or other console</li>
            <li>A Windows laptop but you need to install Bedrock not Java</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'll need to own a copy of minecraft for this device!</p>
        <p>You also need <em>two</em> Microsoft accounts (which are free) - one for a parent, and one for the child.
            This is because children need parental permission for online play, even on private servers.</p>
        <p>There's an article at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link"
                href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077"
                target="_blank">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077</a> with instructions for
            parents on setting up accounts. In brief:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a parent account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com"
                    target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a> </li>
            <li>Go to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home"
                    rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home"
                    target="_blank">the microsoft family homepage</a></li>
            <li>If your child already has a microsoft account, you can add them here, otherwise you can create a new
                account here</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm not quite sure how to link a child's current account with the microsoft account, this might need
            experimentation</p>
        <p>There are some notes on setting up an account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link"
                href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/minecraft-and-microsoft-accounts"
                target="_blank">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/minecraft-and-microsoft-accounts</a></p>
        <h3 data-heading="Microsoft? XBox?">Microsoft? XBox?</h3>
        <p>Confusingly, Mojang who build Minecraft are nowadays owned by Microsoft. Which means you need a Minecraft
            account. Even more confusingly, sometimes you need to go to an XBox site, even if you don't use an XBox, as
            that's where Microsoft store some game profile stuff.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What's the plan">What's the plan</h2>
        <p>From my reading it seems a realm lets us have 3 worlds at once, I was thinking of running:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a Creative world for just building stuff - these give every child total power to build things. But they
                aren't very challenging</li>
            <li>a Survival world for the more challenging main game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initially we can keep the Survival world fairly safe - I might run it as "always day" for a while, as that
            means no mobs (aka monsters) will appear unless you go somewhere dark. (Monsters in Minecraft only spawn in
            darkness - an early stage of any game is to get some light sources, and beds to sleep overnight)</p>
        <p>Also I'll use a few other "easy" settings - and the game admin can cheat and give people resources, if
            someone gets stuck.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="How to make it fair">How to make it fair</h2>
        <p>This is tricky - these kids are young and I'm not sure they are all good at playing nicely.</p>
        <p>TODO</p>
