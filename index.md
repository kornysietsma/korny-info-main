## About me

My full name is Kornelis Sietsma - I tend to use "Kornelis" for formal
correspondance, and "Korny" the rest of the time.

I grew up in Australia - first Geelong then Melbourne - but now I am permanently settled in the lovely town of Leighton Buzzard in the UK.

I work as a principal engineer, troublemaker, and general wise-guy for [Liberis](https://www.liberis.com), a small-business finance company.

## This site

This site is for me to store anything much that doesn't live on [my blog](https://blog.korny.info) - there's not much here but it's nice, say, for storing Minecraft tips for parents as I write them.

Have a look at the top menu bar for any content here - there's not much so far.

## Side projects

My code usually lives [on github](https://github.com/kornysietsma/).

I have one main technical side project - the [Polyglot Code Tools](https://polyglot.korny.info) which are a suite of tools for visualising and understanding software built in a wide range of programming languages (hence "polyglot"). All the details are at <https://polyglot.korny.info>

This goes in bursts as I also have a significant other side project - my family!

## Contact Information

I own the domain `sietsma.com` so email is the best long-term way to get hold of me - <korny@sietsma.com> should get to me unless you hit the spam bucket.

See the sidebar for links - but honestly I'm not really regular on these, my usage is roughly:

- Mastodon is my preferred social network, but it's a firehose I don't always find time to drink from, so not really much presence there
- Linkedin I check every now and then, mostly for work stuff
- BlueSky I'm starting to use a bit more as I'm hoping it kills Twitter, but I am not really active
- Facebook I only use for family and very old friends who use nothing else
- Instagram only if someone sends me an Instagram link
- Threads ditto
- Twitter - I have an account, I don't share it, it's a cess-pit and Musk is a crawling horror

These days a lot of my social chat is private - WhatsApp or Signal, or on Slacks or Discords. As a busy parent I just don't have time for much more.

## Other websites

I run the [Sietsma family web site](https://sietsma.com) but there's almost nothing there at the moment - this page gets more love.

I have a blog at <https://blog.korny.info> which I post to on occasion.  The blog is for new things - long-term pages will probably show up here.  It's always a bit of a work-in-progress.

The [Polyglot Code Tools](https://polyglot.korny.info) site has a lot of information about the tools - it is rather in need of a clean-up, which I'll do - one day.
