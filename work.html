      <h2>Working days</h2>
      <p>
        I work a 4 day week (80% contract) and I don't work Fridays - that's my parenting day!</p>
      <p>
        However I'm usually checking Slack intermittently, no guarantees as kids come first, but ping me there and I
        will get back to you when I can.
      </p>
      <p>I work from home (sunny Leighton Buzzard) but I attempt to be in the London office one day a week - usually Mondays unless there's some strong reason to change.</p>
      <p>My kids like routine, so I avoid changing things around too much!</p>

      <h2>Daily hours</h2>
      <p>I don't like too much presenteeism around work hours - we should work when we are
        most productive, and not force ourselves to particular hours when we are not.</p>
      <p>So this is my overall plan, but the daily specifics may vary. I will keep the team up to date on Slack where I have variations.</p>

      <p>Mondays I commute to London - it takes around 80-90 minutes, with intermittent
        connectivity on the train.  I usually commute around 7:45 to 9:10 in the morning, and
        try to leave the office by 5pm.
      </p>
      <p>Tuesdays to Thursdays I start around 8:15am (depending on how we go getting the kids out the door!) and work until around 4pm</p>
      <p>I then help with kid dinner and general end-of-day chaos around 4-5pm</p>
      <p>Then after dinner I log back in for another 30 to 60 minutes more work, depending on demand and energy levels.</p>
