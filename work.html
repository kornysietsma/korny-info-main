      <h2>Core working times</h2>
      <p>I don't like too much presenteeism around work hours - we should work when we are
        most productive, and not force ourselves to particular hours when we are not.</p>
      <p><strong>But</strong> - remote working means we need to have more explicit communication than before, so I am
        sharing my rough work schedule, so people can plan around me.</p>
      <p>I will keep the team up to date on Slack where I
        have variations.</p>

      <h3>Working days</h3>
      <p>I work a 4 day week (80% contract) and I don't work Fridays - that's my parenting day!</p>
      <p>
        However I'm usually checking Slack intermittently, no guarantees as kids come first, but ping me there and I
        will get back to you when I can.
      </p>
      <p>I work from home (sunny Leighton Buzzard) but I attempt to be in the London office one day a week - usually
        Mondays unless there's some strong reason to change.</p>
      <h3>Daily hours</h3>
      <p><strong>Mondays</strong> I have a 90 minute commute to London - I have some connectivity on the train but not
        much. I usually get to the office by 9:15, and try to leave by 5pm for the long trip home.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tuesdays</strong> I work from around 8:15am until 4pm, then I'm unavailable from 4-5 to help with kid dinners.</p>
      <p>After dinner I log back in for another 30 to 60 minutes more work, depending on demand and energy levels.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Wednesdays</strong> I work from around 8:15am until around 4:30pm</p>
      <p><strong>Thursdays</strong> are the same as Tuesdays - I work from around 8:15am until 4pm, then I'm unavailable from 4-5 to help with kid dinners.</p>
      <p>After dinner I log back in for another 30 to 60 minutes more work, depending on demand and energy levels.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Fridays</strong> I don't work! Well, I work, but at parenting not tech :)</p>
