## Games

### Animal Crossing: New Horizons

![Chatting with Isabelle at the Resident Services desk](/assets/images/family-video-games/animal-crossing-1.jpg)

You arrive on a deserted island and slowly build it into your dream paradise. Catch bugs and fish, dig up fossils, plant flowers, design your house, and make friends with adorable animal villagers. The game runs in real time - different things happen at different times of day and in different seasons, so there's always something new to discover.

![Outdoor island life with Tom Nook and villagers](/assets/images/family-video-games/animal-crossing-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Life simulation - relaxing, creative, no pressure
- **Price:** £49.99 on Nintendo eShop (often £33 on sale, physical copies from £25)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - ideal for creativity, collecting, and relaxing play sessions
- **For a 5yo:** Good - can explore and catch bugs happily, but needs help with reading dialogue and understanding game mechanics
- **For the whole family:** Great for sharing an island (though only one island per Switch) - take turns or watch each other play. Visiting friends' islands online requires Nintendo Switch Online.
- **Co-op:** Up to 4 players can play together on the same island in "Party Play" mode, but it's limited - one player leads and others follow. Best enjoyed as solo or pass-the-controller.

**Good stuff:**
- Incredibly relaxing with no fail states or time pressure
- Endless creativity with home and island decoration
- Real-time seasons mean new fish, bugs, and events year-round
- The animal villagers are charming and memorable

**Watch out for:**
- Only ONE island per Switch console - everyone shares
- Real-time clock can be frustrating (shops close at night, some things take real days)
- Requires patience - the game deliberately unfolds slowly over weeks/months

### Blanc

![The fawn and wolf cub meet in a snowy clearing](/assets/images/family-video-games/blanc-1.jpg)

A wolf cub and a fawn get lost in a snowstorm and have to work together to find their families. Everything is drawn in beautiful black and white, like a picture book come to life. You solve simple puzzles together - the fawn can jump higher, the wolf can push things - and follow the footprints your families left in the snow.

![Working together to solve puzzles in the snowy landscape](/assets/images/family-video-games/blanc-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Co-op puzzle adventure - work together, no combat or stress
- **Price:** £13.49 on Nintendo eShop (often £6.74 on sale - currently on sale!)
- **For a 9yo:** Great - simple two-button controls, no text to read, lovely story about helping each other
- **For a 5yo:** Good with a partner - very simple controls but may get briefly confused about where to go. Best played with an older sibling or parent
- **For the whole family:** Perfect for playing together on the sofa - designed for two players working as a team
- **Co-op:** 2-player local co-op (can also play solo controlling both animals, but it's designed for two)

**Good stuff:**
- Stunning hand-drawn black-and-white art style
- Short and sweet - about 2 hours, so it doesn't outstay its welcome
- No way to fail or die, very relaxing
- Text-free so anyone can play regardless of reading level

**Watch out for:**
- Puzzles are quite simple - won't challenge older players
- Camera can be awkward and framerate drops on Switch sometimes
- Very short for the price (wait for a sale)

### Celeste

![Madeline climbing a snowy mountain with pink hair flying](/assets/images/family-video-games/celeste-1.jpg)

Madeline decides to climb Celeste Mountain, but it turns out the mountain is full of deadly spikes, crumbling platforms, and her own self-doubt. You jump, dash, and climb through hundreds of tough platforming challenges. It's hard - really hard - but the game wants you to succeed and has brilliant accessibility options if you get stuck.

![Navigating through a treacherous cave with moving platforms](/assets/images/family-video-games/celeste-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Precision platformer - jump, dash, climb, die, try again
- **Price:** £17.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £4.49 on sale until Jan 8 - historic low!)
- **For a 9yo:** Good with patience - very challenging but has Assist Mode (slow motion, extra dashes, invincibility) to tune the difficulty exactly how you want. The story about anxiety and believing in yourself is thoughtful and handled maturely.
- **For a 5yo:** Not suitable - the platforming requires precise timing and quick reflexes even with assists. The themes about depression and anxiety are too mature, and frustration is inevitable.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- One of the best platformers ever made - Metacritic 92, won Best Independent Game 2018
- Assist Mode is brilliant - not just "easy mode" but customisable options like infinite stamina, slower game speed, or invincibility
- Controls feel incredibly tight and responsive - when you fail, you know it was your fault
- Fantastic at current sale price - absolute steal for £4.49

**Watch out for:**
- Genuinely difficult - you will die hundreds of times (the game counts your deaths!)
- Story deals with depression and anxiety in meaningful ways - great for the right kid, but not for everyone
- Can be frustrating if you don't enjoy trial-and-error gameplay

### Cocoon

![Bug-like creature carrying a glowing orb through an alien landscape](/assets/images/family-video-games/cocoon-1.jpg)

You play as a tiny bug-like creature exploring strange alien worlds. The twist: you carry orbs that each contain an entire world inside them. Jump into an orb to explore that world, then jump back out and use the orb's special powers to solve puzzles in the outer world. It's like Russian nesting dolls, but as a puzzle game - and it gets wonderfully mind-bending.

![Exploring inside one of the world-orbs with mechanical structures](/assets/images/family-video-games/cocoon-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Puzzle adventure - explore, carry orbs, solve spatial puzzles
- **Price:** £20.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £10.49 on sale until Jan 2 - historic low!)
- **For a 9yo:** Good - the puzzles are genuinely clever and require thinking about "worlds within worlds". No reading needed at all (the whole game is wordless). Some puzzles will make you scratch your head, but the "aha!" moments feel amazing. Boss battles require timing but aren't punishing.
- **For a 5yo:** Too complex - the simple controls (one stick, one button) seem accessible, but the nested world-within-world puzzles require abstract spatial thinking that's beyond most 5-year-olds. They might enjoy watching, but won't solve puzzles independently.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- From the lead designer of LIMBO and INSIDE - elegant, polished puzzle design
- Completely wordless - you learn everything through play, no reading required
- Perfect length at 5-6 hours - doesn't overstay its welcome
- Beautiful alien art style and atmospheric music

**Watch out for:**
- Puzzles can be head-scratching - may need hints for trickier sections
- Abstract and mysterious - if you like clear stories, this might feel confusing

---

### Donkey Kong Bananza

![DK and Pauline riding a giant golden banana through a canyon](/assets/images/family-video-games/donkey-kong-bananza-1.jpg)

Donkey Kong and teenage Pauline head underground to explore the planet's core. The big twist: almost everything can be smashed! Dig tunnels, punch through walls, carve shortcuts, and discover hidden caves as you explore underground biomes from canyons to frozen tundras. DK can also transform into different creatures using "Bananza transformations" - turn into a zebra to run fast or an ostrich to glide.

![Clearing thorns and poison in an underground cavern](/assets/images/family-video-games/donkey-kong-bananza-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** 3D platformer with destructible environments - smash, dig, and explore
- **Price:** £58.99 on Nintendo eShop (physical copies from £50 at Amazon UK)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - colourful, forgiving, and hugely satisfying destruction gameplay. Clear tutorials and intuitive controls. PEGI 7 with only mild cartoon silliness.
- **For a 5yo:** Good in co-op - plays as Pauline riding on DK's shoulder, using singing powers to help unlock paths. Simpler support role while a parent or older sibling controls DK. Solo would be too tricky.
- **For the whole family:** Great asymmetric co-op design - one player controls DK (movement and smashing), the other plays Pauline (special powers and transformations). Perfect for playing with younger kids who want an active role without needing precise platforming skills.
- **Co-op:** 2-player local or online co-op with clever asymmetric roles

**Good stuff:**
- Smashing through terrain feels incredible - carve your own path anywhere
- Called "the Switch 2's killer app" - Metacritic 91
- Co-op design is genuinely thoughtful, not just "second player tags along"
- 100% offline, no microtransactions or ads

**Watch out for:**
- Switch 2 exclusive - won't work on original Switch
- Full price at £59 with no sales yet
- Some frame rate drops during boss battles in docked mode

### Dorfromantik

![Peaceful village landscape made of hexagonal tiles](/assets/images/family-video-games/dorfromantik-1.webp)

You draw hexagonal tiles from a stack and place them to build an ever-growing countryside of villages, forests, rivers, and fields. Match edges well (forest next to forest, river next to river) to score points. Complete quests like "build a forest with 50 trees" to earn more tiles and keep playing longer. It's like the board game Carcassonne but as a peaceful, meditative single-player experience.

![A sprawling landscape with trains, windmills and winding rivers](/assets/images/family-video-games/dorfromantik-2.webp)

- **Genre:** Relaxing tile-placement puzzle - build pretty landscapes, no pressure
- **Price:** £12.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £9.74 on sale until Jan 11 - lowest ever!)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - intuitive and satisfying. You can play casually to build pretty scenes or chase high scores. Sessions are 15-45 minutes. Creative mode has no way to lose.
- **For a 5yo:** Good - PEGI 3 rated. Very simple controls (place and rotate tiles). Can enjoy building pretty countryside without worrying about scoring. May need help understanding quest objectives but can absolutely enjoy the core loop.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- Genuinely calming - described as "sunshine on the screen"
- Multiple modes: creative (no pressure), classic (score-chasing), monthly challenges
- Perfect for short sessions or longer relaxation
- Great value especially on sale

**Watch out for:**
- Very low-key - if you want action or excitement, look elsewhere
- Can feel repetitive after many hours (but by then you've got your money's worth)

---

### GRIS

![Gris meets a giant statue in a soft watercolour world](/assets/images/family-video-games/gris-1.jpg)

You play as a girl named Gris exploring a beautiful watercolour world that's lost all its colour. As you journey through, you unlock new abilities - your dress can turn into a heavy block to smash through obstacles, let you glide through the air, or help you swim underwater. There's no text, no enemies trying to hurt you, and no way to die. It's more like playing through a moving painting than a traditional game.

![Gliding through the red desert landscape](/assets/images/family-video-games/gris-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Artistic platformer - explore, solve gentle puzzles, and restore colour to the world
- **Price:** £14.49 on Nintendo eShop (currently £2.49 on sale until Dec 31 - historic low!)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - no reading needed at all, simple controls, and puzzles that are satisfying but never frustrating. The emotional story about dealing with sadness is told through visuals and music, so you can appreciate it at your own level.
- **For a 5yo:** Good - no danger, no death, and simple platforming. The beautiful colours and magical transformations are captivating. Some puzzles might need a hint, but the whole game is designed to be welcoming.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- One of the most beautiful games ever made - every frame looks like art
- Short and sweet at 3-4 hours, perfect length for a meaningful experience
- The soundtrack is gorgeous and responds to what you're doing

**Watch out for:**
- Very simple gameplay - if you want challenge or action, this isn't it
- The emotional themes about grief might prompt questions (but they're handled gently)

### Hollow Knight: Silksong

![Hornet leaping through the air in combat](/assets/images/family-video-games/hollow-knight-silksong-1.jpg)

You play as Hornet, a fast and acrobatic warrior princess, exploring a vast underground kingdom filled with bugs. Dash, jump, and slash your way through beautiful but dangerous lands, discover secrets, and battle dozens of tough bosses. It's the sequel to Hollow Knight, but with even faster, more exciting movement.

![Exploring the gilded city of Bellhart](/assets/images/family-video-games/hollow-knight-silksong-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Metroidvania action-platformer - explore, fight, unlock new abilities, find secrets
- **Price:** £16.75 on Nintendo eShop (currently £13.40 on sale until 31 Dec - 20% off!)
- **For a 9yo:** Good with caution - brilliant gameplay but notoriously difficult. There's no easy mode or assist options. Expect frustration with tough bosses and tricky platforming. A patient kid who enjoys mastering hard games could love it. Easily-frustrated players may bounce off.
- **For a 5yo:** Not suitable - the difficulty is too high even for most adults. Needs precise timing, complex combat patterns, and real persistence through failure. No accessibility options to help.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- Metacritic 91 - one of the highest-rated games of 2025, called "a masterpiece" by multiple reviewers
- Movement feels incredible - Hornet is faster and more acrobatic than any other Metroidvania hero
- Massive game with 200+ enemies and 40+ bosses - easily 30+ hours of content
- Great value at current sale price

**Watch out for:**
- Really hard - deliberately designed to challenge, with no difficulty options
- The original Hollow Knight is also excellent and cheaper if you want to try the series first
- Frustration is part of the experience - you will die, a lot

### Into the Breach

![Tactical battle grid showing mechs defending cities from giant insects](/assets/images/family-video-games/into-the-breach-1.jpg)

Giant alien bugs called Vek are attacking cities, and you command a squad of three mechs to stop them. The twist: you can see exactly what the enemies will do next turn, so each battle becomes a puzzle - how do you use your moves to push, block, and zap the bugs before they smash the buildings? It's like chess but with giant robots.

![Mission selection screen with objectives and island map](/assets/images/family-video-games/into-the-breach-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Turn-based tactics puzzle - think ahead, no quick reflexes needed
- **Price:** £11.39 on Nintendo eShop (currently £3.41 on sale until 7th Jan - often drops to £3-6)
- **For a 9yo:** Good - rewards logical thinking, Easy mode is genuinely accessible, and losing is normal (you just start a new run with unlocked squads). Great for building planning skills and resilience.
- **For a 5yo:** Too complex - the strategic depth requires thinking several moves ahead and understanding how abilities interact. Recommended age is 10+.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- Perfect puzzle design - every move matters and solutions feel satisfying
- Runs take 2-3 hours, but you can save mid-battle
- Free "Advanced Edition" update added loads more content
- Excellent value, especially on sale - one of the best strategy games ever made

**Watch out for:**
- Requires strategic thinking even on Easy - might frustrate kids who don't like puzzles
- Mild language in text ("a*s", "bastard") - PEGI 12

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

![Link exploring Hyrule with an axe](/assets/images/family-video-games/zelda-botw-1.jpg)

You wake up as Link after a 100-year sleep to find the kingdom of Hyrule in ruins. Now you must explore a vast open world, solve puzzles in ancient shrines, find weapons and armour, cook food for health, and eventually defeat Calamity Ganon. The magic is that you can go anywhere you can see - climb any mountain, glide off any cliff, explore in any order you want.

![Peaceful exploration in Hyrule's meadows](/assets/images/family-video-games/zelda-botw-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Open-world action-adventure - explore, fight, solve puzzles, go anywhere
- **Price:** £59.99 on Nintendo eShop (rarely discounts - physical copies around £28-45)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - one of the greatest games ever made and ideal for this age. Combat is cartoonish with no blood, puzzles encourage creative thinking, and you can tackle challenges in any order. Some bosses are tough but you can always go do something else and come back stronger.
- **For a 5yo:** With help - the open world is magical to explore, but combat, reading, and puzzle-solving need adult assistance. Could enjoy watching or playing together with a parent controlling the tricky bits.
- **Co-op:** Solo only - but great for backseat gaming with siblings suggesting ideas

**Good stuff:**
- Metacritic 97/100 - genuinely one of the best games ever made
- Complete freedom to explore - see a mountain? You can climb it. See a tower? Glide to it.
- 100+ hours of content if you want it, but you can also just head straight to the final boss
- Physics and chemistry systems mean creative solutions always work (set grass on fire to create updrafts, freeze water to make platforms, etc.)

**Watch out for:**
- Full price and rarely discounts - but worth every penny
- Weapons break, which can frustrate some players (but you find new ones constantly)
- So big it might take over your life!

### Lil Gator Game

![Lil Gator surfing on a raft past cardboard pirate ships](/assets/images/family-video-games/lil-gator-game-1.jpg)

You play as a little alligator who wants their big sister to stop doing boring homework and play pretend like they used to. Explore a colourful island, climb anything, glide with a hang glider, and convince other animals to join your adventure game. It's like Breath of the Wild but way easier and cosier - and all the "enemies" are just cardboard cutouts with crayon faces.

![Lil Gator facing cardboard bat enemies in the sky](/assets/images/family-video-games/lil-gator-game-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Cozy exploration adventure - climb, glide, swim, and do quests
- **Price:** £16.75 on Nintendo eShop (often £8-10 on sale)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect! Easy to play, no way to fail, and a sweet story about family and growing up
- **For a 5yo:** Perfect - simple controls, no reading needed to enjoy exploring, very relaxing
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- Feels like playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild but with zero stress
- Short and sweet at 3-5 hours, so it doesn't drag on
- Cardboard swords, shields, and "monsters" are adorable
- Heartfelt story about staying connected with family as you grow up

**Watch out for:**
- Might be too easy if you want any challenge at all
- No quest log or minimap, so you just wander until you find things

---

### Luigi's Mansion 3

![Luigi cautiously exploring the haunted hotel](/assets/images/family-video-games/luigis-mansion-3-1.jpg)

Luigi wins a free stay at a luxury hotel - but surprise, it's haunted and run by King Boo! Mario, Peach, and the Toads get trapped in paintings, and it's up to scaredy-cat Luigi to rescue them. Armed with the Poltergust G-00 vacuum cleaner, you'll explore 17 creepy-but-fun themed floors, solve puzzles, and suck up ghosts.

![Luigi running from King Boo in the hotel lobby](/assets/images/family-video-games/luigis-mansion-3-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Action-adventure ghost hunting - explore, solve puzzles, catch ghosts
- **Price:** £49.99 on Nintendo eShop (rarely discounts digitally; physical copies often £35-40)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - ideal age for the puzzles and ghost-catching. The spooky theme is comedic, not scary (Luigi is the frightened one!). Hint system helps when stuck.
- **For a 5yo:** Good with help - PEGI 7 rating, cartoonish ghost "violence". Can play as Gooigi in co-op with an older sibling guiding them. Some puzzles will need assistance.
- **For the whole family:** Great for couch co-op - player 2 controls Gooigi (Luigi's goo clone) and works together on puzzles. ScreamPark minigames support up to 8 players on one console for family game nights!
- **Co-op:** 2-player local co-op in story mode (Gooigi unlocks ~1 hour in). ScreamPark minigames: up to 8 players locally.

**Good stuff:**
- Every floor has a unique theme (pirate ship, movie studio, Egyptian tomb) keeping things fresh
- Won Best Family Game at The Game Awards 2019 - it earned it
- Gooigi co-op is clever - he can slip through grates and walk on spikes, making puzzles genuinely collaborative
- Looks gorgeous and runs smoothly

**Watch out for:**
- Full price and rarely goes on sale digitally - buy physical for better deals
- Some boss fights can be tricky and may need a few attempts

### Old Man's Journey

![The old man walking through rolling sun-drenched hills](/assets/images/family-video-games/old-mans-journey-1.jpg)

An old man receives a letter and sets off on a journey across beautiful countryside. You help him travel by dragging hills up and down to create paths - line up two hillsides and he can walk from one to the other. As you go, wordless flashbacks show memories from his life. It's more like an interactive picture book than a puzzle game.

![Walking through a colourful hillside village](/assets/images/family-video-games/old-mans-journey-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Puzzle adventure - drag landscapes to make paths, watch the story unfold
- **Price:** £9.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £1.99 on sale until Jan 12 - 80% off!)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - very simple controls, no text to read, and the puzzles are gentle. The story about life, family, and memories might not hit as hard as it does for adults, but the beautiful art and relaxing gameplay still shine.
- **For a 5yo:** Good - incredibly simple (just drag hills), no way to fail, no reading needed. The flashback scenes are pretty to watch even if the emotional meaning goes over their head.
- **Co-op:** Solo only (technically supports 2 players but it's really a solo experience)

**Good stuff:**
- Absolutely gorgeous hand-painted art - every scene looks like a picture book
- Very short (1-2 hours) so perfect for a quiet afternoon
- No stress, no fail states, completely relaxing
- Bargain at current sale price

**Watch out for:**
- Very little "game" here - if you want challenge or action, look elsewhere
- Brief flashback images of drinking and smoking (not interactive, just story scenes)

---

### Outer Wilds

![Exploring alien ruins on a planet with the sun in the background](/assets/images/family-video-games/outer-wilds-1.jpg)

You're a space explorer investigating a solar system trapped in a time loop - every 22 minutes the sun explodes and you wake up back at the campfire. But here's the thing: nothing you collect carries over, only what you *learn*. It's like being a space detective, piecing together an ancient cosmic mystery by exploring strange planets, reading alien texts, and figuring out what's causing this disaster.

![Inside the cosy wooden spacecraft at your home base](/assets/images/family-video-games/outer-wilds-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Exploration mystery - fly a spaceship, explore planets, solve mysteries with your brain
- **Price:** £20.99 on Nintendo eShop (often £12.59 on sale - currently on sale until Jan 2!)
- **For a 9yo:** Maybe with help - PEGI 7 but genuinely challenging. Requires patience, note-taking, and lateral thinking. The time loop means "failing" repeatedly, which can frustrate. Some scary moments in dark areas. A curious 9-year-old who loves puzzles might enjoy this with an adult to discuss discoveries.
- **For a 5yo:** Not suitable - needs reading for clues, complex 3D navigation, and patience with repeated deaths. Some genuinely frightening moments (giant anglerfish in the dark). The abstract story would be confusing.
- **Co-op:** Solo only - but great for discussing discoveries together

**Good stuff:**
- Won BAFTA Game of the Year - one of the most acclaimed games ever made
- "Knowledge is progression" is a brilliant concept - you get better by understanding, not grinding
- Each planet has completely different and surprising mechanics
- Zero combat, pure curiosity-driven exploration

**Watch out for:**
- Some areas are genuinely scary (anglerfish, dark zones) despite the PEGI 7 rating
- The time loop pressure and lack of direction can frustrate players who prefer clear goals
- Switch version has visual downgrades - play elsewhere if you can

---

### Splatoon 3

![Colourful Turf War battle with ink everywhere](/assets/images/family-video-games/splatoon-3-1.jpg)

Two teams of four splat ink everywhere using paint guns, rollers, and brushes - whoever covers more ground wins! You play as a squid kid who can transform into a squid to swim through your team's ink, refill your tank, and zoom around the map. There's also a full single-player campaign with puzzles and boss fights, plus Salmon Run where you team up against waves of weird salmon monsters.

![Salmon Run co-op mode fighting salmon enemies](/assets/images/family-video-games/splatoon-3-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Team shooter - cover territory with ink, no blood or violence
- **Price:** £49.99 on Nintendo eShop (rarely discounts - lowest ever was £39.99)
- **For a 9yo:** Great - fast, colourful, and satisfying. The single-player Hero Mode teaches you the controls before going online. Online matches can get competitive but matchmaking keeps things fair. Reading is minimal (silly puns and short tutorials).
- **For a 5yo:** Too tricky - needs quick reactions and dual-stick aiming that most 5-year-olds haven't developed yet. Could enjoy watching an older sibling play, but independent play isn't realistic.
- **Co-op:** No split-screen! Each player needs their own Switch and copy of the game. Online multiplayer only (requires Nintendo Switch Online subscription).

**Good stuff:**
- The most polished "shooter" that's actually appropriate for kids - PEGI 7
- Salmon Run co-op mode is brilliant chaotic fun
- Looks stunning on Switch 2 (4K/60fps docked)
- Loads of content including the Side Order roguelite DLC

**Watch out for:**
- Requires Nintendo Switch Online subscription for multiplayer (the main point)
- No local co-op at all - frustrating for families with one Switch
- Full price and rarely discounts

### Tetris Effect: Connected

![Tetris gameplay with colourful underwater jellyfish background](/assets/images/family-video-games/tetris-effect-1.jpg)

This isn't just Tetris - every block you drop makes music, and the backgrounds pulse and evolve as you play. One moment you're stacking blocks surrounded by glowing dolphins underwater, the next you're in a neon-lit city or floating through space. It's still classic Tetris (stack blocks, clear lines), but transformed into something that feels like playing an instrument.

![Multiplayer Zone Battle with glowing effects](/assets/images/family-video-games/tetris-effect-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Puzzle rhythm game - classic Tetris with incredible music and visuals
- **Price:** £35.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £17.99 on sale until Jan 11 - historic low price!)
- **For a 9yo:** Perfect - Tetris is timeless and the difficulty settings make it accessible. Beginner mode is forgiving, and there's a Practice mode with no game overs. No reading needed.
- **For a 5yo:** Good - the core "rotate and drop blocks" is intuitive, and Beginner mode plus Practice mode give space to learn without pressure. The mesmerising visuals will captivate them. May need help navigating menus.
- **For the whole family:** Great for passing the controller (everyone has different Tetris styles!) and the new Connected mode lets 3 players team up against AI bosses - genuinely exciting.
- **Co-op:** Local 1-4 players, plus online modes. Connected mode (3-player co-op vs AI) is a highlight. Zone Battle is fun 1v1 competitive.

**Good stuff:**
- Arguably the best Tetris ever made - 10/10 from Nintendo Life
- Journey mode has 30+ stages, each with unique music and visuals
- Excellent accessibility: colorblind modes, traditional block colours, relaxed "Chill Marathon" with constant speed
- Great value at sale price, and the Switch version is perfect for portable play

**Watch out for:**
- Full price (£36) is steep for Tetris - wait for a sale (currently 50% off!)
- Online modes require Nintendo Switch Online subscription

### Tunic

![The fox hero exploring colourful ruins with sword drawn](/assets/images/family-video-games/tunic-1.jpg)

You play as an adorable fox waking up in a mysterious ruined world. Armed with a tiny sword and shield, you explore ancient temples, fight strange creatures, and piece together what happened to this place. The twist: there's an in-game instruction manual written in a made-up language - you find pages scattered around and slowly decode how everything works. It's like being handed a puzzle where even the rules are secret.

![Combat against multiple enemies in a temple](/assets/images/family-video-games/tunic-2.jpg)

- **Genre:** Action-adventure with Zelda-like exploration and challenging combat
- **Price:** £25.19 on Nintendo eShop (currently £12.59 on sale until Jan 11 - historic low!)
- **For a 9yo:** Good with accessibility options - the combat is tough (think "baby Dark Souls") but brilliant accessibility settings let you turn on invincibility or reduce damage whenever you want. The real challenge is figuring out the mysterious manual, which could delight puzzle-lovers or frustrate kids who want clear instructions.
- **For a 5yo:** Too complex - even with invincibility on, the game is all about decoding a cryptic manual and solving environmental puzzles. There's no hand-holding at all, and the mystery-driven progression needs reading and patience beyond most 5-year-olds.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- Beautiful art style and genuinely clever puzzle design - won multiple awards including a BAFTA
- Accessibility options are brilliant - toggle invincibility on/off anytime, even mid-boss fight, and achievements still work
- The "aha!" moments when you decode secrets are magical

**Watch out for:**
- Combat is genuinely difficult without accessibility options
- The cryptic manual can be frustrating if you prefer clear guidance - you're meant to feel confused at first

### Two Point Museum

![Prehistory museum with dinosaur exhibits and visitors](/assets/images/family-video-games/two-point-museum-1.jpg)

You're in charge of building and running museums! Send explorers on expeditions to dig up dinosaur bones, discover supernatural artefacts, and find space relics. Then design your museum layouts, place the exhibits, hire staff, and keep your guests happy (and their children off the displays). It's silly British humour meets theme park management.

- **Genre:** Management simulation - design, build, and run themed museums
- **Price:** £24.99 on Nintendo eShop (currently £19.99 on sale until Dec 31 - lowest ever!)
- **For a 9yo:** Good for strategy fans - the tutorials are thorough and the learning curve is gentle. You'll need to read menus and objectives, and think strategically about layout and money. If you enjoyed Theme Park or similar games, this is perfect. PEGI 3 rating means the content is completely family-friendly.
- **For a 5yo:** Too complex - it's a deep management sim with lots of reading, menus, and planning. Even though it's PEGI 3, the gameplay requires patience and strategic thinking beyond most 5-year-olds. Would need constant adult help.
- **Co-op:** Solo only

**Good stuff:**
- 50+ hours of content across 5 themed museum types (Prehistory, Aquarium, Supernatural, Science, Space)
- Absurdist British humour throughout - man-eating plants, ghost specimens, overpriced gift shops
- Sandbox mode for creative play without objectives or pressure

**Watch out for:**
- Switch 2 exclusive - won't work on original Switch
- Performance can stutter as your museum grows larger
