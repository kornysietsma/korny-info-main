## Core working times

I don't like too much presenteeism around work hours - we should work when we are most productive, and not force ourselves to particular hours when we are not.

**But** - remote working means we need to have more explicit communication than before, so I am sharing my rough work schedule, so people can plan around me.

I will keep the team up to date on Slack where I have variations.

### Working days

I work a 4 day week (80% contract) and I don't work Fridays - that's my parenting day!

However I'm usually checking Slack intermittently, no guarantees as kids come first, but ping me there and I will get back to you when I can.

I work from home (sunny Leighton Buzzard) but I attempt to be in the London office one day a week - usually Mondays unless there's some strong reason to change.

### Daily hours

**Tuesday** I work in the office in London.  It's a 90 minute commute - I have some connectivity on the train but not much. I usually get to the office by 9:15, and try to leave by 5pm for the long trip home.

**Monday, Wednesday and Thursday** I work from around 8:15am until around 5pm, but some days I'll be helping kids out the door / school run at the start of the day, or making dinner at the end of the day.  So if you want me before 9am or after 4pm, try to check with me on Slack first - I try to avoid meetings in those times.

**Friday** I don't work! Well, I work, but at parenting not tech :)
