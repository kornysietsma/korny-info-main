## Core working times

I don't like too much presenteeism around work hours - we should work when we are most productive, and not force ourselves to particular hours when we are not.

**But** - remote working means we need to have more explicit communication than before, so I am sharing my rough work schedule, so people can plan around me.

I will keep the team up to date on Slack where I have variations.

### Working days

I work a 4 day week (80% contract) and I don't work Fridays - that's my parenting day!

However I'm usually checking Slack intermittently, no guarantees as kids come first, but ping me there and I will get back to you when I can. I'm happy to spend 5 minutes unblocking someone, rather than have them have to wait until Monday for an answer.

I work from home (sunny Leighton Buzzard) but I attempt to be in the London office one day a week - currently alternating Tuesdays and Wednesdays, to maximise time with team-mates, though it might change if there are good reasons to be in another day.

### Daily hours

**Office days** On London days - Tuesday/Wednesday alternating - I work in the office in London.  It's a 90 minute commute - I have some connectivity on the train but not much. I usually get to the office by 9:15, and try to leave by 5pm for the long trip home.

**Home work days** The rest of the week I work from my home office. I work from around 8:15am until around 5pm, but some days I'll be helping kids out the door / school run at the start of the day, or making dinner at the end of the day.  So if you want me before 9am or after 4pm, try to check with me on Slack first - I try to avoid meetings in those times.

**Friday** I don't work! Well, I work, but at parenting not tech :)  I do try to stay available on slack - see above.
