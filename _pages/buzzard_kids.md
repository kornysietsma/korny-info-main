This page is mostly for sharing information about how our game is going - things that are hard to share on the in-game board.

## Map

This map is from a few weeks ago - it needs updating with more things we've found!

## Locations we've found

### The coordinate system

Map coordinates are a bit confusing - the top of the screen shows [X, Y, Z] coordinates

- X is the horizontal axis, which is easy.  Negative X is West, positive X is East.
- Y is altitude - where `0` is deep underground, `+64` is sea level.
- Z is the vertical axis. Positive Z is South, negative Z is North.

So a position like [300, 64, 300] is at sea level, to the south-east.

Our starting base is near [0, 64, 0] - the middle of the map.  If you die without having slept on a bed, you will respawn in the base.

### The Nether

The Nether is a parallel dimension you can go to - it's full of lava and monsters and is generally pretty scary.

Distances in the Nether are 1/8 of distances in the Overworld, so it's a handy way to make shortcuts to distant locations - you can build tunnels so monsters can't get to you, and then take shorcuts across the nether.

There's a nether portal in our home base, and lots of signposts to things in the Nether to look at.

### Villages

We've found two nearby villages:

- One to the North-east, near [209, 66, -341] - there's a bridge from our base to a giant construction tower, and then a path to the village
  - There's also a path through the Nether, but now we have a bridge it doesn't help much
- One to the South-west, see the map above - there's a path from our home base.

### Trial Chamber

We found a [Trial Chamber](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Trial_Chambers) - there's a stairway down near [-491, 66, -1109] - it's tough but a lot of fun. There's a path in the Nether to get there.

### Woodland Mansion

There's a woodland mansion at [-6184 80 10696] - a ridiculously long way away.  I built a long long tunnel in the Nether to get there.

### Mineshaft

There's a deep mineshaft below [-74, 63, -208] - not far from our base, a fun place to explore

### Ocean Monument

There's an Ocean Monument near [1123, 64, -1882] but it has already been explored and mined out!

### Bastion

We found a bastion in the nether near [-113,83,341] - we need to build a easier way to get there!
