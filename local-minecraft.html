    <h1>Minecraft for local kids</h1>
    <p>Hi folks! I'm thinking of running a private online Minecraft game for our son's friends. This web page is for
        info and useful links to help parents understand what's involved and decide whether to join.</p>
    <p>(Note - this page is hidden on my public website so only partially private hence no kids&nbsp; names here)</p>
    <h2 data-heading="What's the plan">What's the plan</h2>
    <p>This is open for discussion but my thoughts are:</p>
    <p>I can run an online game for the kids to play together, with some supervision. It would run on a private
        Microsoft server -&nbsp; costs explained below.</p>
    <p>We can run 1 or 2 worlds on the server so I thought we'd run:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a Creative world for just building stuff - these give every child total power to build things. But they
            aren't very challenging</li>
        <li>a Survival world for a more challenging game - I can set it up to be&nbsp; fairly easy to play to begin
            with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To help get it off to a good start, we'll arrange a play date with you where your child brings their device and
        we help you get everything set up.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The nice thing about Minecraft is it is mostly cooperative - and kids can play solo when they want to. To keep it
        fair and fun, we'll need everyone to remember a few rules e.g. don't destroy each other's creations.</p>
    <p>I will be online some of the time to supervise, I’m happy for other parents to join if you want to help.&nbsp;
        And if you want, you can join in the fun!</p>
    <h2 data-heading="How to make it fair and fun">How to make it fair and fun</h2>
    <p>This is tricky - these kids are young and still learning how to play well!</p>
    <p>We will run introduction sessions - so the kids can be helped getting started and working out how to play
        together.</p>
    <p>We can establish some basic player rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Play nicely, don't be mean</li>
        <li>Don't break or damage anyone else's stuff</li>
        <li>Don't enter someone else's base without permission&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Put up signs to help others know what's yours, or even invite them in</li>
        <li>No pranks!</li>
        <li>Rule-breaking could result in warnings or having to take time out of the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can discuss on Whatsapp how things are going and tweak as we go, I'm open to ideas and feedback</p>
    <h2 data-heading="What does it cost?">What does it cost?</h2>
    <p>The game is free for the first month.&nbsp; After that it costs £7 a month collectively - so around £1 a month
        each.</p>
    <p>You do have to have a current version of Minecraft. Also you might have to pay for online gaming (see below)</p>
    <h2 data-heading="What do we need to play?">What do we need to play?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You need a copy of Minecraft (Bedrock edition, which is the standard on consoles and mobile devices) </li>
        <li>You might need to pay for online access - on a Nintendo Switch you need Nintendo Switch Online, on a
            PlayStation you need PlayStation Plus, on XBox you need XBox Game Pass Core.</li>
        <li>To play online you also need a Microsoft account. You actually need two Microsoft accounts - one for a
            parent, and one for the child. This is because children need parental permission for online play, even on
            private servers. The good news is they're free.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 data-heading="Setting up a Microsoft account">Setting up a Microsoft account</h3>
    <p>There's an article at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link"
            href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077"
            target="_blank">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077</a> with instructions for parents
        on setting up Microsoft Family accounts. In brief:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a parent account at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://account.microsoft.com/"
                rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/"
                target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a></li>
        <li>Go to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" rel="noopener"
                class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" target="_blank">the microsoft
                family homepage</a> </li>
        <li>If your child already has a Microsoft account, you can add them here, otherwise you can create a new account
            here</li>
        <li>You should get a 'gamertag' - you can share the users' gamertags with me so I can add them to the realm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some further notes on setting up Minecraft and Microsoft accounts at <a rel="noopener"

    <p>I'm happy to be the main admin - just making sure everything works. But I won't be there all the time. If you
        want to log in and to help keep an eye on things, you're welcome to do that - use your parental Microsoft and
        Minecraft accounts.</p>
    <p>Supervision of things like how much play time parents think is appropriate - I'll leave up to you! We can chat on
        WhatsApp and in the playground about how it's going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Let's just see this as a trial as long as everyone's having fun.</p>
