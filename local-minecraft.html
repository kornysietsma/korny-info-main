    <div><h1 data-heading="Minecraft for local kids">Minecraft for local kids</h1>
        <p>(Note - this page is not really private so not putting any names here)</p>
        <p>Hi folks!  I'm thinking of running a local Minecraft Realms server for our son's friends, this website is for useful links and info.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What is Realms?">What is Realms?</h2>
        <p>Minecraft Realms is Microsoft's private Minecraft servers hosted in the cloud. It runs on their systems and they keep it up to date and secure; it is private, we control it and only people we invite can join.</p>
        <p>See <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/realms-tutorial" target="_blank">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/realms-tutorial</a> for some detailed information.</p>
        <p>There's also <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/parents--guide-minecraft" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/parents--guide-minecraft" target="_blank">the parent's guide to minecraft</a> which is a good basic guide to Minecraft, including a lot of links to settings.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What does it cost">What does it cost</h2>
        <p>The cost is about £7 a month - and that gives us up to 10 simultaneous players.  So £1 a month or maybe just buy me a coffee some time? :)</p>
        <p>Note you <em>also</em> may have to pay extra for online access on some systems.  On a console you might need one of Xbox Game Pass Core, Nintendo Switch Online, or PlayStation Plus to be able to play online. (Android and iOS and Windows users don't need to pay more)</p>
        <h2 data-heading="What do we need to play?">What do we need to play?</h2>
        <p>You need a system that can run the current version of Minecraft Bedrock. (Bedrock is the edition used on consoles, phones and tablets) - one of:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>An Android phone or tablet</li>
        <li>An iPhone or iPad</li>
        <li>A Playstation or XBox or Nintendo Switch</li>
        <li>A Windows laptop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'll need to own a copy of minecraft for this device!</p>
        <p>You also need <em>two</em> Microsoft accounts (which are free) - one for a parent, and one for the child.  This is because children need parental permission for online play, even on private servers.</p>
        <p>There's an article at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077" target="_blank">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077</a> with instructions for parents on setting up accounts.  In brief:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Create a parent account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a> </li>
        <li>Go to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" target="_blank">the microsoft family homepage</a></li>
        <li>If your child already has a microsoft account, you can add them here, otherwise you can create a new account here</li>
        <li>Share the users' gamertags with me so I can add them to the realm</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are some notes on setting up an account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/minecraft-and-microsoft-accounts" target="_blank">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/minecraft-and-microsoft-accounts</a></p>
        <h2 data-heading="What's the plan">What's the plan</h2>
        <p>From my reading it seems a realm lets us have 3 worlds at once, I was thinking of running:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>a Creative world for just building stuff - these give every child total power to build things.  But they aren't very challenging</li>
        <li>a Survival world for the more challenging main game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The nice thing about Minecraft is it is mostly cooperative - and kids can play solo when they want to.  We will have to make sure they don't destroy each other's creations though.</p>
        <p>Initially we can keep the Survival world fairly safe - I might run it as "always day" for a while, as that means no mobs (aka monsters) will appear unless you go somewhere dark.  (Monsters in Minecraft only spawn in darkness - an early stage of any game is to get some light sources, and beds to sleep overnight)</p>
        <p>Also I'll use a few other "easy" settings - like not losing your stuff if you die.  And admins can always 'cheat' and give people support if they need it.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="How to administer it">How to administer it</h2>
        <p>I'm happy to be the main admin - just making sure everything works.  But I won't be there all the time - if other folks want to jump in and help keep an eye on things, that'd be great too.</p>
        <p>Supervision of things like how much play time parents think is appropriate - I'll leave up to you!  Hopefully we can chat on WhatsApp about any admin things.</p>
        <h2 data-heading="How to make it fair and fun">How to make it fair and fun</h2>
        <p>This is tricky - these kids are young and still learning how to play well!</p>
        <p>I think we'll need:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Some basic rules in language a 7yo can understand:
        <ul>
        <li>Don't break or damage someone else's stuff</li>
        <li>Don't enter someone else's base without permission (I might give them signs "Rowan's Base - keep out!")</li>
        <li>Don't hassle or even annoy another player</li>
        <li>No pranks!</li>
        <li>Breaking a rule can get you suspended from the server - longer suspensions for worse behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I'm not sure if we should discourage them from talking about the game? I don't want it getting cliquey at school.</li>
        <li>Maybe we need to do a trial and keep talking about what can be improved</li>
        </ul>
