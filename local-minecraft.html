    <h1 data-heading="Minecraft for local kids">Minecraft for local kids</h1>
    <p>(Note - this page is not really private so not putting any names here)</p>
    <p>Hi folks! I'm thinking of running a private online Minecraft game for our son's friends, this website is for
        useful links and info.</p>
    <h2 data-heading="What's the plan">What's the plan</h2>
    <p>This is open for discussion but my thoughts are:</p>
    <p>I can run an online game for the kids to play together, with some supervision. It would run on a private server -
        Microsoft will rent you a private server for £7 a month, so the cost is pretty small (you might need to also pay
        for online gaming from a console - see below)</p>
    <p>That pays for two games so I thought we'd run:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a Creative world for just building stuff - these give every child total power to build things. But they
            aren't very challenging</li>
        <li>a Survival world for the more challenging main game - though I'd set it up with fairly easy settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Probably we'd start with kids coming to our place (with their devices!) so we can show them how it works, get
        everything set up, and the rest. </p>
    <p>The nice thing about Minecraft is it is mostly cooperative - and kids can play solo when they want to. We will
        have to make sure they don't destroy each other's creations though.</p>
    <h2 data-heading="How to make it fair and fun">How to make it fair and fun</h2>
    <p>This is tricky - these kids are young and still learning how to play well!</p>
    <p>I think we'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some basic rules in language a 7yo can understand:
            <ul>
                <li>Play nicely, don't be mean</li>
                <li>Don't break or damage someone else's stuff</li>
                <li>Don't enter someone else's base without permission (I might set up some separate private areas
                    before they play)</li>
                <li>No pranks!</li>
                <li>Breaking a rule can get you suspended from the server - longer suspensions for worse behaviour</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>An introduction session - so the kids can be helped getting started and play together, and they can talk to
            each other (the game has chat but only text messages)</li>
        <li>We can discuss on Whatsapp how things are going and tweak as we go</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 data-heading="What does it cost?">What does it cost?</h2>
    <p>All we need to pay is the £7 a month - that gives us 2 games for up to 10 simultaneous players.<br>
        So around £1 a month each, or maybe just buy me a coffee some time? :)</p>
    <p>You do have to have a current version of Minecraft, and </p>
    <h2 data-heading="What do we need to play?">What do we need to play?</h2>
    <p>You need a copy of Minecraft (Bedrock edition, which is the standard on consoles and mobile devices)</p>
    <p>On a console you might need to pay for online access - Nintendo Switch Online, PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass
        Core (Android and Apple phone/tablet users don't need to pay more)</p>
    <p>To play online you also you need a free Microsoft account. You actually need <em>two</em> Microsoft accounts -
        one for a parent, and one for the child. This is because children need parental permission for online play, even
        on private servers.</p>
    <p>There's an article at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link"
            href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077"
            target="_blank">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077</a> with instructions for parents
        on setting up accounts. In brief:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a parent account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com"
                target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a> </li>
        <li>Go to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" rel="noopener"
                class="external-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/home" target="_blank">the microsoft
                family homepage</a></li>
        <li>If your child already has a microsoft account, you can add them here, otherwise you can create a new account
            here</li>
        <li>You should get a 'gamertag' - you can share the users' gamertags with me so I can add them to the realm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some notes on setting up an account at <a rel="noopener" class="external-link"

    <h2 data-heading="How will we administer this">How will we administer this</h2>
    <p>I'm happy to be the main admin - just making sure everything works. But I won't be there all the time - if other
        folks want to jump in and help keep an eye on things, that'd be great too.</p>
    <p>Supervision of things like how much play time parents think is appropriate - I'll leave up to you! Hopefully we
        can chat on WhatsApp about any admin things.</p>
